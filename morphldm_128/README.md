# MorphLDM
MorphLDM is a 3D brain MRI generation method based on state-of-the-art latent diffusion models (LDMs) that generates novel images by applying synthesized deformation fields to a learned template. [[link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03778)]


## Dependencies
- You can reuse the environment you built from https://github.com/tracyhann/3D_Brain_partsLDM/tree/tracy_0220_ddp
- MorphLDM code builds directly on [MONAI](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/dev) and [GenerativeModels](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels) repositories.
Make sure they are installed and included in your PYTHONPATH.

MorphLDM differs from LDMs in the design of the encoder/decoder. 
First, a learned template is outputted by a template decoder, optionally conditioned on image-level attributes. 
Then, an encoder takes in both an image and the template and outputs a latent embedding; this latent is passed to a deformation field decoder, whose output deformation field is applied to the template. 
Finally, a registration loss is minimized between the original image and the deformed template with respect to the encoder and both decoders. 
Subsequently, a diffusion model is trained on these learned latent embeddings.

To synthesize an image, MorphLDM generates a novel latent in the same way as standard LDMs. 
The decoder maps this latent to its corresponding deformation field, which is subsequently applied to the learned template.
